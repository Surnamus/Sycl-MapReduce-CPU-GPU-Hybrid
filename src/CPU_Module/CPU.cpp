Chocolate Cake with Cherries and Chocolate Ganache
Ingredients

For the Cake:

    1 ¾ cups (220 g) all-purpose flour

    2 cups (400 g) sugar

    ¾ cup (65 g) unsweetened cocoa powder

    1 ½ tsp baking powder

    1 ½ tsp baking soda

    1 tsp salt

    2 large eggs

    1 cup (240 ml) whole milk

    ½ cup (120 ml) vegetable oil

    2 tsp vanilla extract

    1 cup (240 ml) hot coffee or water

For the Filling and Topping:

    1 cup (240 ml) heavy cream

    8 oz (225 g) semisweet or dark chocolate, chopped (for ganache)

    1 jar (about 16 oz / 450 g) sour cherries in syrup, drained

    Extra chocolate shavings or curls, for garnish

Instructions

    Preheat oven to 350°F (175°C). Grease and line two 8-inch (20 cm) round cake pans with parchment.

    In a large bowl, whisk together flour, sugar, cocoa powder, baking powder, baking soda, and salt.

    Add eggs, milk, oil, and vanilla. Beat on medium speed for 2 minutes. Stir in hot coffee or water. Batter will be thin.

    Pour into prepared pans and bake 30–35 minutes, until a toothpick inserted comes out clean. Cool completely.

    To make the ganache, heat the cream in a saucepan just to a simmer. Pour over chopped chocolate in a bowl and let sit 2–3 minutes. Stir until smooth and glossy. Let cool to a spreadable consistency.

    Drain the cherries and pat them dry.

    To assemble, place one cake layer on a plate. Spread a thin layer of ganache, then scatter cherries on top. Add the second cake layer. Cover the whole cake with remaining ganache.

    Garnish with chocolate shavings or curls and a few cherries on top if desired.

    Chill slightly to set, but let come to room temperature before serving.
